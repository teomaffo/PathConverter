# PathConverter
##Windows to Linux shell path converter.

A simple program that takes the path of a Windows directory as input and converts it into a directory for the Linux terminal.
I created this simple program to go to a folder with a single instruction.
The file is written in C because it was an exercise that I invented to practice for an exam in C.

Then I compiled the program with a compiler for C ++ in order to have the executable .exe.
